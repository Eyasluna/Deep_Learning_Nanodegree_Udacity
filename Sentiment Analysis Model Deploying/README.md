## Project Overview
Welcome to the SageMaker deployment project! In this project you will construct a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. You will create this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, you will deploy your model and construct a simple web app which will interact with the deployed model.

## Project Instructions
The deployment project which you will be working on is intended to be done using Amazon's SageMaker platform. In particular, it is assumed that you have a working notebook instance in which you can clone the deployment repository.

## Evaluation
Your project will be reviewed by a Udacity reviewer against the deployment project rubric. Review this rubric thoroughly, and self-evaluate your project before submission. All criteria found in the rubric must meet specifications for you to pass.

## Project Submission
Collect all of the files in the project directory and compress them into a single archive for upload. In particular, make sure that the following files are included:

The SageMaker Project.ipynb file with fully functional code, all code cells executed and displaying output, and all questions answered.


An HTML or PDF export of the project notebook with the name report.html or report.pdf.


The completed train/train.py and serve/predict.py python files.


The edited website/index.html file.
